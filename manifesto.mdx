description: "Infrastructure for the cynical developer."

1. The Vision

stdio is not a SaaS tool. It is Invisible Infrastructure.

We are not building something for people to "spend time" in. We are building something for people to configure and forget. We are the steel pipe through which millions of dollars flow. We are not the pretty wallpaper.

Mission: Convert the bureaucratic chaos of EDI into clean, predictable JSON.

Enemy: Complexity, "Drag and Drop" UIs, slow Wizards, and Marketing Fluff.

2. The User

We do not design for the "Average User". We design for The Cynical Developer.

Profile: Agency CTO or Senior Backend Dev.

State of Mind: Stressed, 20 tabs open in VS Code, drinking cold coffee, hates being sold smoke.

Values: CTRL+C / CTRL+V, Clear Documentation, Dark Mode, Speed (&lt;100ms).

Hates: Welcome modals, guided tours, excessive whitespace, animations lasting > 0.2s.

3. Design Principles

A. Terminal-First Aesthetic

Our interface must feel like an extension of the IDE (VS Code) or the Terminal.

Information Density > Whitespace. A developer prefers 50 lines of logs over 5 pretty cards with shadows.

Monospace is King. Data (JSON, Order IDs, Errors) is always monospace.

Syntax Highlighting. Everything that looks like code must have Syntax Highlighting.

B. Functional Brutalism

No Decoration. No illustrations of "people working". No 3D icons.

Sharp Edges. border-radius: 0px or 4px max. No soft, round buttons.

High Contrast. No gray on gray. White on Black. Military readability.

C. The "Zero Click" Rule

The best UI is the one that doesn't exist. If the user can do it via API, the UI is secondary. The UI is only for Observability (logs/errors) and Access Management (API Keys). Not for operations.
