description: "How we map JSON to EDI X12."

We do not use black-box magic. Our mapping logic is deterministic and transparent.

## The Inbound Flow (850 -> JSON)

When Walmart sends a Purchase Order (850), we extract only the fields necessary for Shopify fulfillment.

* BEG-03 -> shopify_order_id (PO Number)
* DTM-02 -> created_at
* N1*ST -> shipping_address
* PO1 Loop -> line_items

## The Outbound Flow (JSON -> 856)

This is the most critical transaction. The ASN (856) tells Walmart a package is on the way.

### SOIP Structure

We automatically structure your flat JSON into the required X12 Hierarchy:

* S (Shipment): Carrier tracking (TD5 segment).
* O (Order): Reference to original PO (PRF segment).
* I (Item): SKU details (LIN segment).
* P (Pack): Physical packaging (MAN segment).

<Warning>
Tracking Numbers are Mandatory. If you send an ASN without a valid tracking number in the TD5 segment, Walmart will reject the payment.
