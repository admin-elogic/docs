Understanding the difference between Marketplace and Vendor (DSV) is critical to understanding why stdio exists.

## The Problem (The Gap)

Most Shopify Apps (e.g., "Marketplace Connect") are built for the left column. They cannot handle EDI X12, AS2 Encryption, or the strict ASN (856) requirements of the Vendor program.

If you try to use a Marketplace tool for a Vendor contract:

1. Walmart will not receive your shipment data.
2. You will be fined (Chargebacks).
3. Your contract will be terminated.

## The Solution

stdio bridges this gap. We allow you to treat a Vendor Contract like a Marketplace channel. You send JSON; we handle the 1990s bureaucracy.
